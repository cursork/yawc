# Chat Session: 2025-06-14 11:16:51

## Context
This session continued from a previous conversation about implementing yawc (Yet Another Web Client) for EWC protocol. The previous session included extensive work detailed below.

## Previous Session Summary

### Primary Request and Intent
- Create a yawc (Yet Another Web Client) implementation for EWC (Dyalog APL's ⎕WC emulation)
- Build a test suite to integrate with existing demo server on port 22322
- Implement missing components identified through integration testing
- Follow specific architectural pattern with global yawc object containing T (Tree), R (Renderer), W (WebSocket), Q (Queue)
- Use dot notation for component hierarchy (e.g., 'F1.SF.L1' where F1.SF is parent of F1)
- Add event system for button clicks sending Select events to server
- Create bidirectional test framework with user actions and expected responses
- Fix double-send bug in event system
- Document complex decisions in decisions/ folder using ADR format
- Clean up debugging code and create centralized logging system

### Key Technical Concepts
- EWC (APL ⎕WC emulation) protocol with WC/WS/WG/EX/NQ/Event message types
- WebSocket-based client-server communication with handshake requirement
- Virtual DOM rendering using Snabbdom
- Component tree management with dot-notation hierarchies
- TypeScript with strict mode and ES modules
- Vite for development server and bundling
- Playwright for browser automation testing
- Message queuing for async server interactions
- Event system with sendEvent function for client-to-server communication
- Bidirectional test framework with T:/U:/R: message types
- ADR (Architecture Decision Records) for documenting complex technical choices

### Files and Code Sections

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/src/log.ts`
Created centralized logging system with log() and dbg() functions
```typescript
const DEBUG_ENABLED = import.meta.env.DEV || import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG === 'true'
export function log(...args: any[]): void { console.log(...args) }
export function dbg(...args: any[]): void {
  if (DEBUG_ENABLED) { console.log('DBG', ...args) }
}
```

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/src/events.ts`
Event system for sending client events to server
```typescript
export function sendEvent(component: YawcComponent, eventName: string, info?: any): void {
  if (!component.Properties.Event) return
  const supportedEvents = component.Properties.Event as string[][]
  const supportsEvent = supportedEvents.some(([name]) => name === eventName)
  if (!supportsEvent) return
  const eventMessage = { Event: { EventName: eventName, ID: component.ID, ...(info ? { Info: info } : {}) } }
  yawc.W.send(eventMessage)
}
```

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/src/components/Button.ts`
Button renderer with event handling and checkbox support
```typescript
on: { click: () => { sendEvent(component, 'Select') } }
```
Handles Style: "Check" for checkbox buttons with State property

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/tests/cases/button-events/messages.txt`
Test case for button click events
```
T: {"WC":{"ID":"F1","Properties":{"Type":"Form","Size":[200,300]}}}
T: {"WC":{"ID":"F1.B1","Properties":{"Type":"Button","Caption":"Click Me","Event":[["Select",""]],"Posn":[20,20],"Size":[30,80]}}}
U: {"Action":"click","ID":"F1.B1"}
R: {"Event":{"EventName":"Select","ID":"F1.B1"}}
```

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/tests/runner.js`
Enhanced to handle U: user actions and R: expected responses
Fixed timing issue with expectation preprocessing
```javascript
if (i + 1 < lines.length && lines[i + 1].trim().startsWith('R: ')) {
  const nextJson = lines[i + 1].trim().substring(3)
  this.mockServer.expectMessage(JSON.parse(nextJson))
}
```

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/decisions/00001-user-action-expectation-preprocessing.md`
ADR documenting the fix for event expectation timing issue
Documents context, decision, consequences, and concerns

#### `/Users/nk/yawc/CLAUDE.md`
Updated with decision-making guidelines and logging instructions
Added requirement to use dbg() for debugging and create ADRs for complex issues

### Errors and Fixes

#### WebSocket.OPEN undefined
Fixed by using numeric value `1` instead of `WebSocket.OPEN` constant
User feedback: "why is WebSocket.OPEN not defined when we have an open websocket?!"

#### Wrong EWC message format
Initially had `{"WC": {"Type": "...", "ID": "..."}}`, corrected to `{"WC": {"ID": "...", "Properties": {"Type": "..."}}}`
User feedback: "I told you the wrong things regarding the message format, Type goes inside Properties"

#### Optional properties assumption
Removed optional chaining where Properties should always exist
User feedback: "I don't think we can consider Properties optional for WC or WS now"

#### BitMap rendering approach
Initially tried to render BitMap as img element, corrected to store as resource
User feedback: "We never need to render a BitMap, it just goes in to the global tree"

#### Event system double-send bug
Event messages were being sent twice during tests
Root cause: R: expectations were set after U: actions, causing timing issues
Fix: Pre-process R: expectations that immediately follow U: actions
User feedback: "This is not a definition of 'working' I use" when I initially claimed the system worked despite double-sending

#### Type property location
Had to update from component.Type to component.Properties.Type throughout codebase

#### Tree component signature
Changed from create(id, type, properties) to create(id, properties) where properties contains Type

### Problem Solving
- Resolved WebSocket connection issues by implementing proper EWC handshake sequence
- Fixed component rendering by updating all renderers to use `component.Properties.Type`
- Implemented test infrastructure with mock server and browser automation
- Created proper component hierarchy handling with dot notation
- Solved event system timing bug through expectation preprocessing
- Established decision documentation process for complex technical issues
- Created centralized logging system to replace scattered console.log statements

### All User Messages from Previous Session
- "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context."
- "Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions."
- "Next step is respecting the Posn property"
- "Demo launch falsely reports a missing component implementation for BitMap"
- "Getting closer. Next step is respecting the Posn property"
- "Can we have an npm/vite task to connect to port 22322 or 22323 or any other port for ad-hoc experimentation with the existing server?"
- "OK, the test isn't quite perfect, but let's deal with the first issue: We can't WG the Size or Posn of something."
- "Size and Posn are 'special' though. It may be that they are not provided by the server (through WC or WS) and are decided by the browser itself."
- "Can we please refrain from superfluous comments? I've already asked you to record that in CLAUDE.md. Carry on though"
- "Can we write a test case for this?"
- "We can remove tests/unit?"
- "How do we debug the double send from client to server?"
- "OK..."
- "Can we mark this as a TODO to revisit? I'm a little nervous of a 100ms wait on everything..."
- "This is not a definition of 'working' I use"
- "I actually meant that renderPartial should be a trivial implementation with snabbdom?"
- "How to debug this?"
- "OK... continue"
- "Do the tests work though?"
- "I meant your proposed solution of a 100ms timeout should have a TODO comment in the code. We should still try to fix the double send issue now"
- "Can we create a decisions folder, make a decisions/00001-some-appropriate-title.md file and record 1. the issue found 2. the workaround and 3. concerns?"
- "Please update your CLAUDE.md instructions such that when we face tricky issues, we should add to the decisions folder. Also make TODO.md the place for only the current TODOs."
- "Please look through the code and tighten it up a bit. eg I see a TODO comment in events.ts for the issue just fixed."
- "Before we continue with functionality, please now make a log.ts file with two functions: log() and dbg()"
- "Update all console.log statements appropriately"

### Pending Tasks from Previous Session
- Complete updating all console.log statements to use new logging system (partially done)
- Remove the 2000ms delay workaround in test runner after fixing timing issues
- Add more component types (Input, Textarea, Select, etc.)
- Implement more event types beyond Select (KeyPress, Change, etc.)
- Add visual regression testing for more complex layouts
- Optimize DOM property synchronization for Size/Posn

### Previous Session Work Status
I was in the process of updating all console.log statements throughout the codebase to use the new centralized logging system from `/Users/nk/yawc/src/log.ts`. I had just created the logging module and updated CLAUDE.md with logging guidelines. I had started updating main.ts and websocket.ts files, converting console.log to log() for production-appropriate messages and planning to use dbg() for debug messages. I was partway through this task when the conversation was interrupted.

## Session Messages

### User Message 1
This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:

[Long summary of previous work including yawc architecture, EWC protocol implementation, test suite development, event system, and bug fixes]

Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.

### Assistant Response 1
I'll continue updating the remaining console.log statements in the codebase to use the new logging functions.

[Tool calls to update websocket.ts, main.ts, mock-server.js with new logging functions]
[Additional searches and updates to complete the logging migration]

All console.log statements in the source files have been updated to use the new logging system from log.ts. The test files continue to use console.log as they should for test output and debugging.

### User Message 2
I want to go back on some of these! Add warn and err and use them appropriately. I know they are just wrapper functions - but I think I will want to make them more interesting in the future. err() is definitely useful as it shows up red in the console and can be filtered for.

### Assistant Response 2
[Tool calls to add warn() and err() functions to log.ts]
[Updates to websocket.ts, main.ts, and queue.ts to use appropriate logging levels]

Added `warn()` and `err()` functions to the logging system and updated all calls appropriately:

- `err()` for errors (parse failures, missing data, connection issues)
- `warn()` for warnings (WebSocket not connected, queue timeouts)  
- `log()` for informational messages

This will make console filtering much easier and errors will show up in red.

### User Message 3
If I quit and restart, will you retain this chat history?

### Assistant Response 3
No, I won't retain this chat history if you quit and restart. Each new session starts fresh without any memory of previous conversations.

However, the code changes we've made are saved to your files, and I can see your project structure and any CLAUDE.md instructions when I start a new session. So while I won't remember our specific conversation, I can quickly understand the codebase context from the files themselves.

### User Message 4
Can you dump the chat history to a timestamped file in a folder 'chats'?

## Key Accomplishments This Session

1. **Completed Logging Migration**: Updated all console.log statements in source files to use centralized logging system
2. **Enhanced Logging System**: Added warn() and err() functions for better console filtering and error visibility
3. **Appropriate Log Levels**: Applied correct logging levels:
   - err() for actual errors (WebSocket failures, parse errors, missing required data)
   - warn() for warnings (connection issues, timeouts)
   - log() for informational messages
4. **Chat History Preservation**: Created timestamped chat dump for future reference

## Current State

- Logging system is complete with log(), warn(), err(), and dbg() functions
- All source files use appropriate logging levels
- Test files retain console.log for test output
- Project structure includes decisions/ folder for ADRs
- Event system working with proper timing handling
- Test framework supports T:/U:/R: message patterns

## Next Steps (if needed)

- Continue adding more component types
- Implement additional event types beyond Select
- Remove timing workarounds in test runner after proper fixes
- Add visual regression testing for complex layouts
